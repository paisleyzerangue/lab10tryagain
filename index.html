<font face="Trebuchet MS" color="black" size="+1">Hello, my name is Paisley and I'm here to tell you a little bit about myself.
<br>
<br>
I'm a 22 (almost 23) year old Temple College student just trying to get by. I've gotten my own apartment recently and I'll be honest, stuff's been stressful.
<br>
There is so much to learn about life it's crazy. Living alone is great and all but it's a little upsetting because I've always lived with at least one person.
<br>
Even though I do isolate myself a lot, I still always had someone to go and talk to in the same household.
<br>
Other stuff has been happening as well but I've already taken up enough of your time and it's things that are too personal to share here.
<br>
<br>
Anyways, The first link will take you to my resume. You can find out more about me there.
<br>
And the second link will take you to a page about my YouTube channel.
<br>
Feel free to stay as long as you'd like!
